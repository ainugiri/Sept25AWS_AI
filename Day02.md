lambda - serverless computing

uploading image to S3 bucket
My aim is to reduce the size / optimize 
usually, we need storage, computing service (algo), it will store result in S3

with lambda, not required to manage servers or infrastructure
whenever there is a image upload to S3 bucket, it will trigger a lambda function -> it will execute the image optimization algorithm and store the optimized image back in S3.

S3 - 5gb : 20000,2000
EBS - 30gb

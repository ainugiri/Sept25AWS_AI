Artificial Intelligence

Artificial : Man made 
Intelligence : The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

1956 - Dartmouth Conference: The birth of AI as a field.
Computer Generation at 1956 : The first generation of computers, characterized by vacuum tubes and magnetic drums.
 - Vacuum tubes
 - Magnetic drums
 - functions: Basic arithmetic operations, data storage and retrieval

Computer can think like human, performs tasks such as learning.


Rule Based AI:
 - No Learning
 - Finite set (input - output)
 - Signal (red - Stop, green - Go, yellow - Caution)

MYCIN: Rule based expert system for diagnosing bacterial infections and recommending antibiotics.
input: Patient symptoms and medical history
output: Recommended antibiotics based on rules and patient data
Rule based system 1-1 mapping, then it will useful for specific cases.

But multiple value for a single input can lead to ambiguity and requires more complex rules or additional context to resolve.


1970 - Winter Period, AI research funding decreased, many projects halted.

Machine Learning:
 - Learn from data
 1 year old car sold for 18000,17900,17950,18100,18000,18000,18000,18000
 2 year old car sold for 16000,15900,15950,16100,16000,16000,16000,16000

 <!-- Historical Data -->
 <!-- 17900 to 18100  -->
 <!-- average for 18000,17900,17950,18100,18000,18000,18000,18000 = 18012.5 -->
 <!-- propose 18050  -->
